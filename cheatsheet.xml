         This cheatsheet shows some of the cheatsheet commands JBoss Tools Project Examples comes with.
         One of those commands are org.jboss.tools.project.examples.cheatsheet.getProjectForCheatsheet which allows you to get a variable representing the project this cheatsheet is inside.

   <item
         skip="false"
         title="Welcome to this project">
      <description>
         It is important to force this to be run to make the variable resolved - a simple way to make that happen is to add an required command as seen below.
      </description>
      <command
            required="true"
            returns="currentProject"
            serialization="org.jboss.tools.project.examples.cheatsheet.getProjectForCheatsheet"/>
   </item>
   <item
   	     skip="true"
         title="Open a file">
      <description>
         Now when we have started the cheatsheet executed the getProjectForCheatsheet and we can now refer to it via 'currentProject' embedded in ${} in other commands, such as org.jboss.tools.project.examples.cheatsheet.openFileInEditor which allow you to open a file on a specific line.

      <command
            required="false"
            serialization="org.jboss.tools.project.examples.cheatsheet.openFileInEditor(path=/${currentProject}/cheatsheet.xml,fromLine=27,toLine=29)"/>
   </item>
</cheatsheet>
